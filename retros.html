    <h2>10-9-2019</h2>
    <p>Today's lesson involved learning about Linux, and using the Linux command line. I learned how to create folders with mkdir, files with touch and rm, and navigate around the file system with cd, ls, using the Terminal. I feel like I have a good grasp of how to get around the Terminal. While I do not know the command line front-to-back like a regular graphical interface, and that may block me,the cheat sheet I created today will help me if I forget things.

    <h2>10-14-2019</h2>
    <p>During today's lesson, we learned the basics of HTML, how it works, and how to create webpages with HTML. We learned tags, their purpose, and their usage. We also learned the history of the Internet and the World Wide Web.</p>
    <h2>10-15-2019</h2>
    <p>With today's lesson, we learned how to use git to track changes, and how to push changes to github repositories. We also learned how to use CSS to style our sites with CSS documents separate from our HTML files.</p>
    <h2>10-16-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we created additional webpages for our personal projects: our about page, our project page, and our contact page. We also learned about wireframing to propose and revise designs before we code sites. We also were introduced to using the Bootstrap framework to make things easier for us when designing sites.</p>
    <h2>10-17-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we created a webpage using Bootstrap and all the tools it offers to lay out and style pages. I also spent my time helping out many people in the class. That being said, while I definitely helped, I'm not totally sure if I taught them or just did it for them.</p>
    <h2>10-21-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we learned the basics of JavaScript, and using the programming concepts from the first week in JavaScript. We learned how the basics of functions worked as well. There is nothing blocking me here. But I am still not confident in positioning items in CSS with the box model (absolute, relative, fixed) as I learned in the Codecademy HW. This is something I don't need now, but I would like to deepen my understanding of this for the future.</p>
    <h2>10-22-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we learned how loops and arrays worked in JavaScript. I worked on the "foobar" challenge. Getting the logic down was the easier part for me; translating the logic to code was the hard part.</p>
