    <h2>10-9-2019</h2>
    <p>Today's lesson involved learning about Linux, and using the Linux command line. I learned how to create folders with mkdir, files with touch and rm, and navigate around the file system with cd, ls, using the Terminal. I feel like I have a good grasp of how to get around the Terminal. While I do not know the command line front-to-back like a regular graphical interface, and that may block me,the cheat sheet I created today will help me if I forget things.

    <p>Today we created additional webpages for our personal projects: our about page, our project page, and our contact page.
