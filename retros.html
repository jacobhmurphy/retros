    <h2>10-9-2019</h2>
    <p>Today's lesson involved learning about Linux, and using the Linux command line. I learned how to create folders with mkdir, files with touch and rm, and navigate around the file system with cd, ls, using the Terminal. I feel like I have a good grasp of how to get around the Terminal. While I do not know the command line front-to-back like a regular graphical interface, and that may block me,the cheat sheet I created today will help me if I forget things. 
    </p>
    <h2>10-14-2019</h2>
    <p>During today's lesson, we learned the basics of HTML, how it works, and how to create webpages with HTML. We learned tags, their purpose, and their usage. We also learned the history of the Internet and the World Wide Web.</p>
    <h2>10-15-2019</h2>
    <p>With today's lesson, we learned how to use git to track changes, and how to push changes to github repositories. We also learned how to use CSS to style our sites with CSS documents separate from our HTML files.</p>
    <h2>10-16-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we created additional webpages for our personal projects: our about page, our project page, and our contact page. We also learned about wireframing to propose and revise designs before we code sites. We also were introduced to using the Bootstrap framework to make things easier for us when designing sites.</p>
    <h2>10-17-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we created a webpage using Bootstrap and all the tools it offers to lay out and style pages. I also spent my time helping out many people in the class. That being said, while I definitely helped, I'm not totally sure if I taught them or just did it for them.</p>
    <h2>10-21-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we learned the basics of JavaScript, and using the programming concepts from the first week in JavaScript. We learned how the basics of functions worked as well. There is nothing blocking me here. But I am still not confident in positioning items in CSS with the box model (absolute, relative, fixed) as I learned in the Codecademy HW. This is something I don't need now, but I would like to deepen my understanding of this for the future.</p>
    <h2>10-22-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we learned how loops and arrays worked in JavaScript. I worked on the "foobar" challenge. Getting the logic down was the easier part for me; translating the logic to code was the hard part.</p>
    <h2>10-23-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we learned about objects in JavaScript, and how to call properties and methods in objects. We also applied some of our knowledge of JS programming concepts into a game. Nothing is currently blocking me. I may work on personal projects later.</p>
    <h2>10-24-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we learned how to use JavaScript to modify HTML elements. We use JavaScript to make pages dynamic and responsive to user actions instead of static. Nothing is blocking me right now. I feel mostly confident in how to work with JavaScript but I feel like I could use some more practice to really master it. I believe I have finished my project for class, so I'll just enjoy the free time this weekend.</p>
    <h2>10-28-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we had a very basic introduction to Node.js, which allows us to use JavaScript on the server. Our challenge today involved review of objects, and properties and methods of objects. Nothing is currently blocking me as far as classwork. I may look into Node more when I get home today.</p>
    <h2>10-29-2019</h2>
    <p>Today we learned about using classes. Classes define generic objects, from which we can assign specific properties to. There is one more thing I have to touch up on the Tamagotchi project. Maybe I'll work on this homework. Nothing is currently blocking me from what we've learned in class, but I do have some slight confusion with closures.</p>
